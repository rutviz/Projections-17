A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/mattsince87/pen/vdEbg.

 This is an Animated (**responsive**) SVG Path with a Jquery Callback all using the awesome [SnapSVG][1] library! I've been playing with this library for about a month and this is what i've managed to come up with so far.

* [SnapSVG][1]
* Rebound of my other [Pen][2]
* **Heart if you like!**
